       angles, commonly used in aircraft orientation.  In this coordinate
       system, the positive z-axis is down toward Earth.  Yaw is the angle
       between Sensor x-axis and Earth magnetic North (or true North if
       corrected for local declination, looking down on the sensor positive
       yaw is counterclockwise.  Pitch is angle between sensor x-axis and
       Earth ground plane, toward the Earth is positive, up toward the sky is
       negative.  Roll is angle between sensor y-axis and Earth ground plane,
       y-axis up is positive roll.  These arise from the definition of the
       homogeneous rotation matrix constructed from q.  Tait-Bryan
       angles as well as Euler angles are non-commutative; that is, the get
       the correct orientation the rotations must be applied in the correct
